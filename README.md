Hola! My name is Rafael Chavez, however most people call me Rafa.

I enjoy writing Python and try to find time outside of work to improve on my Python skillset. 

I have written some simple scripts to help me scrape data from ESPN to get NBA players statistics.
I have not finished the project yet but I do have my progress on there.

I also started a python script for my current role as IT Admin which helps me simplify, analyze, and extract data from 
the ticket queue. More update on that as I go!
